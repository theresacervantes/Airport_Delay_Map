Airport Delay Map
----

This project attempts to create a live-streaming map of US airport delays based on [Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) RESTful API](http://services.faa.gov/docs/basics/) and [OurAirports](http://ourairports.com/data/) data. It is my final project for GalvanizeU's Data Engineering course.
